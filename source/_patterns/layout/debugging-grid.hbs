        For us Graphic Design is “organization of information.” There are other
        types of graphic design more concerned with illustration or of a
        narrative nature.

      <p class="outline lh-copy measure f4">
        Nothing could be more useful to reach our intention than the Grid. The
        grid represents the basic structure of our graphic design, it helps to
        organize the content, it provides consistency, it gives an orderly look
        and it projects a level of intellectual elegance that we like to
        express.

      <p class="outline lh-copy measure f5">
        ahere are infinite kinds of grids, but just one - the most appropriate -
        for any problem. Therefore, it becomes important to know which kind of
        grid is the most appropriate. The basic understanding is that the
        smaller the module of the grid the least helpful it could be. We could
        say that an empty page is a page with an infintesimal small grid.
        Therefore, it is equivalent to not being there. Conversely a page with a
        coarse grid is a very restricting grid offering too few alternatives.
        The secret is to nd the proper kind of grid for the job at hand.
