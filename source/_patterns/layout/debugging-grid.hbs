      The debug grid module allows you to put a background grid on any element
      which can help you line elements up vertically and horizontally with
      eachother. Sometimes across large amounts of whitespace it can be tough to
      see if things are aligned. The background grid comes in both 8 and 16px
      columns.
    </p>
    <p class="measure f5 lh-copy">
      The debug module is commented out at the bottom of the src/tachyons.css
      file. If you uncomment it a 1px outline will be placed on every element on
      the page. Each element has a different color outline. The purpose of this
      is to help distinguish elements that are close together by giving them
      different colors. This has been helpful at times when the outlines are
      overlapping by 1 or 2 pixels and it’s hard to tell where one element ends
      and the other begins.

        For us Graphic Design is “organization of information.” There are other
        types of graphic design more concerned with illustration or of a
        narrative nature.

      <p class="outline lh-copy measure f4">
        Nothing could be more useful to reach our intention than the Grid. The
        grid represents the basic structure of our graphic design, it helps to
        organize the content, it provides consistency, it gives an orderly look
        and it projects a level of intellectual elegance that we like to
        express.

      <p class="outline lh-copy measure f5">
        ahere are infinite kinds of grids, but just one - the most appropriate -
        for any problem. Therefore, it becomes important to know which kind of
        grid is the most appropriate. The basic understanding is that the
        smaller the module of the grid the least helpful it could be. We could
        say that an empty page is a page with an infintesimal small grid.
        Therefore, it is equivalent to not being there. Conversely a page with a
        coarse grid is a very restricting grid offering too few alternatives.
        The secret is to nd the proper kind of grid for the job at hand.
