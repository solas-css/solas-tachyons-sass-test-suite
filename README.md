# Tachyons-Haru Test Suite

A visual regression test suite for Tachyons-Haru built using [Pattern Lab](https://patternlab.io/) and [BackstopJS](https://github.com/garris/BackstopJS).

The primary goal of this test suite is to test possible regressions against the last major Tachyons build [v4.12.0](https://github.com/tachyons-css/tachyons/), released on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tachyons).

This suite is largely a subset of the Tachyons documentation. Eventually as Tachyons-Haru diverges from the parent project, we will expand this into a more comprehensive source of documentation for Tachyons-Haru.
