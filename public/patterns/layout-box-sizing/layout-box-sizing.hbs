    <p class="measure f4 lh-copy">
      The box model has been known to trip up a few people. This module should
      make things a bit easier.
    </p>
    <p class="measure f5 lh-copy">
      While many people make fun of Microsoft’s ‘Internet Explorer’ browser -
      the one thing that most css authors agree on is that it’s the most
      favorable box model. Fortunately the box-sizing property is well supported
      now so we can fix the atrocity that is the box model that chrome, firefox,
      safari, and others have implemented in modern browsers.
    </p>
    <p class="measure f5 lh-copy">
      While the * { box-sizing: border-box; } hack has become quite popular -
      not all elements (think form inputs) benefit from this box model. This
      module only applies the border-box model to certain elements as listed
      below. There is also a .border-box class you can apply to elements as
      needed.
    </p>
    <p class="measure f5 lh-copy">
      The benefit of border-box as opposed to content-box (which is the default
      per the css spec) is that when you declare a width, that is the width of
      the element, regardless of how much border or padding you add to the
      element.
