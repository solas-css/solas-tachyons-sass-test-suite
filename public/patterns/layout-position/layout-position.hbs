      Html elements are initially set to a position of 'static'. Tachyons
      provides classes for setting position to be relative or absolute.
    </p>
    <p class="measure f5 f4-ns">
      Absolute elements are absolutely positioned inside of a relative element.
      You can use absolute positioning to stretch elements making sure they fill
      the width and height of a relative container. Relatively positioned
      elements offer the ability to offset the position of an element without
      affecting the position of any elements around it. This module should be
      used in conjunction with the coordinates module which is used to give
      working examples on this page.
    </p>
    <p class="measure f5 f4-ns lh-copy">
      css also provides an option for setting position to 'sticky' but it is not
      included in this module. If you do find it useful you could easily extend
      the position module to include this option. It should be noted that sticky
      is not well supported at the moment. If the provided coordinates don’t
      suit your needs the module is easy to extend to add any values you might
      need.
